        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I cannot properly express to you how much I <em>love</em> this salsa. It was a recipe I got a from a friend and began playing around with. It is absolutely delicious with an incredibly well-rounded flavor. Personally, I am a huge fan of spicy food so keep that in mind when looking at these measurements - if you're not big on heat, feel free to decrease the amounts. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Roma tomatoes, scored across the bottom.</li>
                <li>4 cloves of garlic, cut in half.</li>
                <li>1 serrano pepper</li>
                <li>1 can Fire Roasted Rotel</li>
                <li>1 can Cilantro Lime Rotel</li>
                <li>1 lime</li>
                
                <li>Cilantro (I use 1/2 a large bunch)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>2 tsp coriander</li>
                <li>1.5 tsp chili powder</li>
                <li>1.5 tsp paprika</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
                <li>A pinch of garlic powder</li>
                <li>A pinch of onion powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Open and drain cans of Rotel, add to food processor.</li>
                <li>Add cut cloves of garlic to food processor.</li>
                <li>Boil small pot of water, when at a rolling boil, add scored tomatoes. Cook for 1 minute or until the skin begin peeling, then immediately add to ice bath.</li>
                <li>While tomatoes are cooling in ice bath, roast serrano pepper on the stove burner until charred. Cut into smaller pieces and add to food processor.</li>
                <li>Peel skin off and quarter tomatoes. Scoop out seeds and add tomatoes to food processor.</li>
                <li>Add coriander, chili powder, paprika, cumin, and salt and pepper, and garlic and onion powder to food processor.</li>
                <li>Pick off as much cilantro as you like - you don't have to be meticulous, it's fine if some stem is in there - and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add lime juice. 1/2 to whole lime, depending on how juicy it is.</li>
                <li>Blend just a bit so the salsa is still fairly chunky, add cilantro, blend a bit more.</li>
                <li>Taste test, see if it needs to be adjusted.</li>
                <li>Add to tupperware and put in the fridge for a bit to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
