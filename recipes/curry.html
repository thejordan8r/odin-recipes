   <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
        Full of chicken, seasoning and aromatics, and veggies, curry chicken is somewhat time consuming to prep, but <em>well worth</em> the effort. The best thing about this recipe is how easy it is to tinker with it until it's perfect for you. From start to finish, it takes about a couple of hours to prepare - but don't let that deter you because it yields approximately 6 servings and keeps for about four days in the fridge. I promise if you put in the time, you will not be disappointed by this powerhouse dish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           
            <li>4 tbsp (approximate) curry power</li>
            <li>2 tsp allspice</li>
            <li>Naan bread</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vinegar</li>
            <li>1 bouillon cube</li>
            <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2-3tbsp of cornstarch, depending on preference of thickness.</li>
            <li>3 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1.5lbs of chicken breast (cubed)</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 serrano, minced (pepper of your choice, really)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ginger (minced)</li>
            <li>1 bunch of green onion chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium size yellow onion roughly diced</li>
            <li>3-5 carrots (depending on size) roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 zucchinis cut into 1/2 inch pieces </li>
            <li>1 russet potato cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>2 cups of rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Mince ginger, garlic, and serrano pepper, and add to a gallon Ziploc bag.</li>
            <li>Chop green onion and dice yellow onion, add half of each to gallon bag, add the rest to a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Chop carrots, add to bag</li>
            <li>Peel and cut potato. I cut the potato in to smaller pieces to reduce cooking time, but if you want to let the curry simmer for longer, you can cut the potato into larger pieces. Add to separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut zucchini into fairly large, approximately 1/2 inch pieces so they maintain their integrity during cooking. Add to bowl with potato.</li>
            <li>Cut chicken into 1in cubes, add to a bowl with vinegar. Toss chicken, then rinse in water, and pat dry with a paper towel. Add chicken to bag.</li>
            <li>Add bouillon cube, 1tbsp vegetable oil, curry powder, allspice, and thyme to bag. Salt and pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Put everything in the fridge, and let the chicken marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>After letting the curry marinate, add 2tbsp of vegetable to a pot and heat over medium heat until the oil is hot is less viscous and add 1tbsp curry power. Mix quickly and cook for 30-45 seconds, until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Once fragrant, add bag of chicken to the pot and cover with a lid. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring occassionally.</li>
            <li>After the 15 minutes are up, uncover, add the rest of the onions and potato and zucchini, along with cornstarch and enough water to cover veggies. </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, allow to boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low. Allow to simmer for at least 30 minutes or until potatoes are cooked, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>While curry is simmering, rinse and cook your rice.</li>
            <li>When potatoes are cooked, turn off the heat and taste. Add seasonings if you feel it needs a little more, usually a little more salt and pepper is needed.</li>
            <li>Serve with rice and naan bread.</li>
        </ol>
