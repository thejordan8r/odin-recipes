# odin-recipes
This project is 4 webpages 1 home page, and 3 with recipes, varying headings, images, and relative links. Working on this project, I have displayed a knowledge of Git workflow and basic commands, the ability to write and edit code within VS Code, and problem solving skills. I am confident in my ability to craft a basic page, manipulate image sizes, create both ordered and unordered lists, and have fun while doing so.
